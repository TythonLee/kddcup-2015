Data Descriptions
test.7z

test.7z contains testing data. For each file in this archive, the format is the same as the counterpart in the train.7z.

date.csv.7z

date.csv -- each line contains the timespan of each course in our log data (both train and test data). The timespan of each course for calculating dropouts is 10 days after the last day of that course, i.e.,  course C is from 2014.4.1 to 2014.4.30 in the given data, a user enrolled the course C will be treated as a dropout if he/she leaves no record from 2014.5.1 to 2014.5.10.
- course_id - course id
- from - the first day of the course in log
- to - the last day of the course in log

object.csv.7z

object.csv - each line in this file describes a module in a course with its category, children objects and release time. Those modules represent different online materials of the courses, e.g., chapters, videos, problem sets and etc. The modules are organized as a tree, i.e., each course contains several chapters; each chapter contains several sections; and each section contains several objects (videos, problem sets, and etc).
- course_id - The course to which the module belongs.
- module_id - The ID of a course module.
- category - The category of the course module.
- children - The children modules of the course module.
- start - The time that the module was released to students.
sampleSubmission.csv.7z

sampleSubmission.csv - each line contains the enrollment ids of the test set and shows the submission format for the competition.The right format of submission file should only contain 2 columns with no header or other information. An error will be reported if a submission file has a wrong format.
- 1st column- Enrollment ID.
- 2nd column - A real-valued probability of dropout.
train.7z

train.7z contains training data.

enrollment_train.csv Ã¢â‚¬â€? eeach line is a course enrollment record with an enrollment id, a username U and a course id C, indicating that U enrolled in course C.
- enrollment_id Ã¢â‚¬â€? Enrollment ID
- username - Student ID.
- course_id - Course ID.

log_train.csv Ã¢â‚¬â€? each line is a behavior record called Ã¢â‚¬Å“eventÃ¢â‚¬Â?. Each event contains the following information: enrollment_id, username, course_id, time, source (server or browser), event, and object. 
- enrollment_id - Enrollment ID.
- time - Time of the event.
- source - Event source (server or browser).
- event - In terms of event type, we defined 7 different event types:
  1. problem - Working on course assignments.
  2. video - Watching course videos.
  3. access - Accessing other course objects except videos and assignments.
  4. wiki - Accessing the course wiki.
  5. discussion - Accessing the course forum.
  6. navigate - Navigating to other part of the course.
  7. page_close Ã¢â‚¬â€? Closing the web page.
- object - The object the student access or navigate to.

true_trian.csv Ã¢â‚¬â€? each line contains information about the ground truth of enrollments in the training set. 
- 1st column - Enrollment ID. 
- 2nd column - Ground truth of dropout (1 for a dropout event and 0 for continuing study)
